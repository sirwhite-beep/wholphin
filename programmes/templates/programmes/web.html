   <p><h5> Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web
    development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications (Web apps),
    electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include
    Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security
    configuration, and e-commerce development.</h5></p><br>
     <P><h5>Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web
    development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</h5></P><br>

<p><h5>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like
    Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer,
    or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a
    collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer
    specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior
    and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.</h5></p><br>
